            funds) of the Entry Fee. Entry will normally be on a first-come-first-served
            basis except that priority may be given to teams who have previously competed
            and those who pledge higher amounts of sponsorship. Entry is at the sole
            discretion of the Secretary to the Event, who may reject an entry without
            giving any reasons.</p>

            the Event which must be displayed on the car or motorbikes. Teams may request a
            team number but priority will be given to teams who have used a given Team
            Number in previous Elephant Charges.</p>

          <h5>FEES AND SPONSORSHIP PLEDGES</h5>

          <p>The Fuchs Elephant Charge 2017 is run on a not-for-profit
            basis and its purpose is to raise money for Charge Charities.</p>

          <p>An entry fee of K2,500 must be paid by each team. The entry
            fee will be used by the organisers to pay for any event costs not covered by
            event sponsors.</p>

          <p>Teams are required to pledge a minimum of K4,000 sponsorship
            at the time they enter the event. Teams will not be allowed to start the event
            unless their pledged sponsorship has been received. All sponsorship received by
            the event will be paid to the Charge Charities.</p>

          <h5>ADVERTISING</h5>

          <p>While entrants are encouraged to find and advertise their
            own sponsors, they MUST carry on their cars any advertising provided by the
            organisers.</p>

          <h5>INSURANCE</h5>

          <p>Teams will take part entirely at their own risk. The
            arrangement of Personal Accident Insurance, Comprehensive Vehicle Insurance etc
            is the responsibility of the Competitor.</p>

          <h5>RUNNING OF THE EVENT</h5>

          <h6>Registration and Scrutineering</h6>

          <p>All teams must report to registration at the Charge location
            for sign-in, collection of pledges and fitting of GPS Tracking Devices between
            09:00hrs and 12:00hrs on Friday 13th October.</p>

          <p>Each team will be scrutineered, issued with sponsors
            material and fitted with a GPS Tracking Device.</p>

          <p>At scrutineering, vehicles will be checked for the items
            listed under ELIGABILITY AND EQUIPMENT above.</p>

          <p>Scrutineering for bike teams will include a check for
            suitable personal protective equipment for each rider. Each rider should report
            to scrutineering with all their equipment.</p>

          <h6>Driver's Briefing</h6>

          <p>A Driver's Briefing will be held at 16:00hrs on Friday 13th
            October. At the briefing each team will be issued with a course map showing the
            location and giving the coordinates of each of the 10 checkpoints and the HQ.</p>

          <p>Each team will also be given their starting checkpoint by
            random draw and a route card which must be carried on the charge. Depending on
            their starting checkpoint, each team will be informed of their convoy letter
            (A, B, C etc) for the following morning.</p>

          <p>Teams should study the map to decide on their route
            (checkpoints can be completed in any order) and identify the Tsetse-lines and
            Gauntlet.</p>

          <h6>Start</h6>

          <p>On the race day, Saturday 14<sup>th</sup> October, teams
            will proceed to a designated assembly point near HQ by 05:30hrs. At the
            assembly point, teams will gather in their respective starting convoys â€“
            identified by convoy letter (A, B, C etc). They will then proceed in convoy to
            their Starting checkpoints by following an escort vehicle. Competitors will be
            started by the marshal at their checkpoint at 07:00 prompt.</p>

          <p>Vehicles at each Starting checkpoint will be mass started,
            and teams will then choose their own route within the restrictions given
            elsewhere in the regulations, and may visit checkpoints in any order.</p>

          <h6>Checkpoints</h6>

          <p>Teams must park their vehicles within the marked area at
            each checkpoint. At each checkpoint teams must have their Route Card filled in
            and signed by the Checkpoint Marshal.</p>

          <p>Teams will only be judged to have visited a checkpoint if
            their Route Card is filled in and signed. Teams presenting an incomplete Route
            Card at HQ will be given a result of &quot;Did Not Complete&quot;.</p>

          <p>A bike team will only be judged to have reached a checkpoint
            once the last bike in the team arrives. Bike teams may not leave the checkpoint
            until the last bike has arrived and the Route Card has been completed.</p>

          <p>As a safety precaution, teams are required to declare their
            next intended checkpoint at the start of each leg. This is to enable the organisers
            to keep track of vehicles throughout the day and to monitor the progress of
            each vehicle in order that a search can be immediately called if any vehicle
            becomes unduly delayed on any leg.</p>

          <p>In the interests of safety, the Clerk of the Course may
            instruct a Checkpoint Marshal to hold an entrant who is intending to commence a
            leg which could not possibly be completed before the end of the Charge. This
            decision will be made individually in each case by the Clerk of the Course, and
            their decision will be final.</p>

          <h6>Tsetse-lines</h6>

          <p>There will be two Tsetse-lines on the course. These are legs
            between two checkpoints where a straight line traverse includes particularly
            challenging terrain.</p>

          <p>The Tsetse-lines will be identified during the Driver's
            Briefing.</p>

          <p>Special awards are made (and much respect gained) for the
            team with the shortest distance achieved for each of the two Tsetse-lines.</p>

          <h6>The Gauntlet</h6>

          <p>Three of the checkpoints on the course will together
            comprise the Gauntlet. To finish the course all teams must complete the
            Gauntlet. The Gauntlet checkpoints will be identified in the Driver's Briefing.</p>

          <p>Teams may traverse the Gauntlet by whichever route they
            choose and the Gauntlet checkpoints may be visited in any order but once
            started, teams must complete the Gauntlet before proceeding to any other
            checkpoint.</p>

          <p>The distance travelled through the Gauntlet will be
            multiplied by three when calculating each teams total distance over the course.</p>

          <h6>Finish</h6>

          <p>To finish, each team vehicle must visit every checkpoint â€“
            in any order - and then return to their starting checkpoint making a complete
            circuit.</p>

          <p>All the bikes and riders in a bike team must complete the
            course for that team to be considered to have finished.</p>

          <p>The Charge finishes at 15:00hrs. Checkpoint Marshalls will
            not endorse Route Cards after this time and teams who have not completed a full
            circuit by this time will be recorded as &quot;Did Not Complete&quot;. All
            teams must report back to HQ as soon as possible after 15:00hrs on race day.</p>

          <p>Teams who do not visit every checkpoint or do not return to
            their Starting checkpoint will be marked &quot;Did Not Complete&quot; in the
            results.</p>

          <p>Each team's course distance (including the multiplied
            distance through the Gauntlet) and time is measured for the complete circuit
            from Starting checkpoint back to Starting checkpoint via all the intermediate
            checkpoints.</p>

          <h6>HQ Check-in</h6>

          <p>Having completed the course each team must return to HQ and
            check-in by:</p>

          Returning their completed Route Card
          Have their GPS Tracking Device downloaded and removed from the vehicle

          <p>Teams who do not report to HQ after coming off the course
            cannot be given a result or placing and will be recorded as &quot;Did Not
            Complete&quot;.</p>

          <p>Failure to check-in at HQ will also trigger a search for
            that vehicle. It is therefore very important that, even in the case of an early
            retirement during the day, teams register with HQ as soon as they can after
            completing the event.</p>

          <h6>Winner</h6>

          <p>The winning team will be the one who completes the course in
            the shortest distance as determined by the Clerk of the Course. The official
            results announced at prize giving are final and no challenge or discussion of
            the results or awards will be entertained.</p>

          <h5>OTHER REGULATIONS</h5>

          <p>For reasons of safety, teams must comply with any
            instructions given by the Clerk of the Course or their representatives.</p>

          <h6>Assistance on the course</h6>

          <p>Teams may not receive any assistance from non-competitors
            except while stopped at checkpoints where teams may only be provided with:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Fuel</li>
            <li>Tyres</li>
            <li>Food and water</li>
            <li>Assistance from a medical, religious or legal practitioner</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Non-competitors may not assist competitors in any other way.</p>

          <h6>Speed on the course</h6>

          <p>The Elephant Charge is a test of technique and not speed.
            For reasons of safety for competitors and spectators a speed limit of 40km/hr
            is enforced for all vehicles on and around the course. Where evidence from the GPS
            Tracking Device shows any team to have repeatedly exceeded this speed limit
            then they may be disqualified at the discretion of the Clerk of the Course.</p>

          <h6>Conduct on the course</h6>

          <p>There will be Marshalls throughout the course and any
            entrant adjudged to have contravened the rules or the spirit of the event may
            be penalized or disqualified at the discretion of the Clerk of the Course.</p>

          <p>Vehicles may be manhandled across the terrain by any means
            devised by the crew's ingenuity, except that no outside assistance is permitted
            whether it is in mechanical, human or animal form, except that given by another
            competitor.</p>

          <p>The following are examples of what will constitute an
            infringement:-</p>

          <ul>
            <li>External assistance of any sort, other than from another competitor.</li>
            <li>Tampering in any way with the proper operation of the GPS Tracking Device.</li>
            <li>Deliberately blocking the passage of other competing cars or behaving in an unsporting manner.</li>
            <li>The formation of groups of two or more teams as a means of enabling one team to gain competitive advantage.</li>
            <li>Wanton destruction of the environment.</li>
            <li>Damage to crops, building etc.</li>
            <li>The use of radios or mobile phones except in an emergency.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The Clerk of the Course may
            require a team to pay compensation if they damage any property.</p>

          <h5>CAMPING</h5>

          <p>Everyone attending the Elephant Charge will be camping at
            the site and all competitors, supporters and spectators must bring their own
            camping equipment.</p>

          <p>There will be a site entry fee of K50 per vehicle payable on
            entry. This entry fee will be donated to the local community who are hosting us
            at the site.</p>

          <p>There will be a specific camping area set aside for entrants
            and their teams. All campers MUST TIDY UP their camp before departing, and
            leave the area perfectly clean. Do not leave the bags of rubbish at your
            campsites. Take them with you.</p>
