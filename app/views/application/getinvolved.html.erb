              <p>Enter a team for the Fuchs Elephant Charge 2017, help raise money for conservation and
                have a incredible weekend of off-road excitement in the Zambian bush.</p>
              <p>
                You don't need a specialised vehicle to enter the Elephant Charge, anything will do
                so long as you don't mind it getting a few scrapes and bumps. Teams can be between 4 and 6 people. You
                will
                be camping in a wonderful part of the Zambian bush for at least two nights over the Elephant Charge
                weekend
                and we try to choose a venue each year which is easy to reach from Lusaka and familly friendly.
              </p>
              <p>
                Entry fees for teams are $500 - or a discounted rate of $400 is you sign up before the end of July.
                In addition you must make a minimum pledge to the Charge Beneficiaries of $800. The purpose of the
                Elephant Charge
                is to raise as much money for conservation and of course you are encouraged to use whatever fundraising
                ideas
                or sponsorship you can to increase your total. The most prestigious award given at the Charge is
                the <b><i>Sausage Tree Trophy</i> for the Highest Sponsorship Raised</b> and this is the trophy everyone
                is
                trying to get their hands on.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you are interested in entering a team and joining the charge then please contact us by email on
                <a href="mailto:info@elephantcharge.org">info@elephantcharge.org</a> and we can explain more about how
